Taking a screenshot on your computer can be helpful for so many things. From quickly showing someone an issue you're troubleshooting to grabbing ideas for your next big project to helping out a friend or family member by showing them how to do something, the list is endless. However, taking a screenshot differs from device to device, operating system to operating system. And that includes Chromebooks and ChromeOS.  

## Screenshot on a Chromebook with a keyboard shortcut

To launch the Screen Capture toolbar, you must press a three-key shortcut: Shift+Ctrl+Show Windows. The Show Windows key is up on the keyboard's top row with an icon that looks like a window with two windows stacked behind it. Just press those three and the toolbar will pop up at the bottom of the screen. 

Also, if you simply want to take a fast shot of your entire screen, as opposed to a specific region or window, you can simply press Ctrl+Show Windows.

These Chromebook keyboard shortcuts will work on any model. However, some Chromebooks have a Screen Capture key on the keyboard's top row. Look for a key with a camera icon on it, usually a rectangle with a circle in the center. When pressed it will automatically launch the tool -- no key combo necessary. 

## How to take a partial screenshot on Chromebook

* Find the content you want to take a screenshot of.
* Hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys and then press the Show Windows key. 
* A message will appear telling you to 'Drag to select an area to capture.' Your cursor will also have changed into a crosshair and the screen will have dimmed.
* Using the mouse/trackpad, drag to select the area you wish to capture. The area you are capturing will be highlighted.
* Press the 'Capture' button in the centre of the screenshot. As before, your screenshot will be saved into the My Files/Downloads area.

## How to take a screenshot of a window on Chromebook

* Find the content you want to take a screenshot of.
* Hold down the Ctrl and Alt keys and then press the Show Windows key.
* This will bring up the Chrome OS Screenshot toolbar at the bottom of the screen.
* Press the right-most of the three central icons on the toolbar. This is the 'Window screenshot' option. 
* With that option selected, your cursor will have changed into a camera icon. Position the icon over the window you want to screenshot and click. This will capture just the one window, rather than your entire screen. As before, your screenshot will be saved into your My Files folder.
